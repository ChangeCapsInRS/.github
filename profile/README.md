Our project is focused on enhancing how we describe changes in remote-sensing images. We aim to automatically generate detailed captions that explain what has changed over time in various environments. We will provide a series of unique datasets that include different types of imagery, such as optical, radar, and multispectral images. These datasets are carefully designed to show changes in diverse scenarios, from city growth to environmental changes.

In addition to these datasets, we will develop new methods to create more accurate and detailed captions. Our goal is to improve how changes in landscapes, cities, and disaster areas are communicated, helping with decision-making in areas like environmental monitoring and urban planning.

This project will make remote sensing data more understandable and useful for researchers, decision-makers, and the public.

Exciting developments are on the horizonâ€”stay tuned for what's coming soon!
